# Multi-modalSensorDataCollection
The goal of this assignment is to get familiar with the smartphone’s multi-modal sensing capability. This assignment will introduce you to the smartphone’s development environment through a real life coding exercise.

Team Members : [Abrar Ahmed Mohammed] & [Richa Kulkarni]

Stage1: Collected the raw sensor data in real time and store them in a csv file in the smartphone. #The CSV files have been submitted as .ZIP

Stage2: The activities such as IDLE, WALKING, RUNNING, JUMPING, TAKING STAIRS have been performed with the mobile phone held by two hands, screen facing up and directing the phone’s y-axis towards the direction that you are facing.

Stage3: Pedometer has been implemented without the use of in-built sensor and it works just fine with (+-)1-2 steps error.

Stage4: 3D graphs are plotted in .ipynb notebook

Stage5: Pushed real-time data stream to FIREBASE REAL-TIME DATABASE and stored it.
